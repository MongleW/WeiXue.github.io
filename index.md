## About Me

I am currently a final-year Ph.D. candidate at <a href="https://www.ru.nl/clst/"> Center for Language and Speech Technology </a> at <a href="https://www.ru.nl/"> Radboud University </a>, The Netherlands, under the supervision of <a href="https://www.ru.nl/en/people/strik-w"> Assoc. Prof. Helmer Strik</a>, <a href="https://www.ru.nl/en/people/hout-r-van"> Prof. emer. Roeland van Hout </a>, and <a href="https://www.ru.nl/en/people/cucchiarini-c"> Dr. Catia Cucchiarini </a>. As a part of the  <a href="https://www.tapas-etn-eu.org/"> EU H2020-ITN-ETN-MSCA *Training Network on Automatic Processing of PAthological Speech* (TAPAS) </a> project, <a href="https://www.tapas-etn-eu.org/Members/wei--xue/myblog"> my PhD research </a> specifically focused on assessing the speech intelligibility of pathological speech. My recent work has focused on experimental methods to study aspects of speech production and perception. Another focus of my recent work is improving auotmatic speech recognition in the assessment of speech quality for imparied speech. In 2021, I conducted my secondment at University Hospital of Antwerp (UZA) under the co-supervision of <a href="https://www.uza.be/persoon/mevr-gwen-van-nuffelen"> Prof. Gwen van Nuffelen</a>. I obtained my Master's degree from <a href="http://www.tju.edu.cn/english/index.htm"> Tianjin University </a> in 2017, and my Bachlor's degree from <a href="http://en.hainanu.edu.cn/ "> Hainan University </a> in 2014.
