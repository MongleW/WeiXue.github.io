## About Me

I am currently a final-year Ph.D. candidate at Center for Language and Speech Technology at Radboud University, The Netherlands, under the supervision of Assoc. Prof. Helmer Strik, Prof. emer. Roeland van Hout, and Dr. Catia Cucchiarini. As a part of the EU H2020-ITN-ETN-MSCA TAPAS (short for *Training Network on Automatic Processing of PAthological Speech*) project, my PhD research specifically focused on assessing the speech intelligibility of pathological speech. In 2021, I conducted my secondment at University Hospital of Antwerp (UZA) under the co-supervision of Prof. Gwen van Nuffelen. In 2014 and 2010, I obtained my Master's and Bachlor's degree at Tianjing University and Hainan University, respectively. 

The combination of my background in signal processing and experience in linguistics has led me to encompass research interests from speech to linguistic topics, such as phonetics, speech perception and production. My recent work has focused on experimental methods to study aspects of speech production and perception. Another focus of my recent work is improving auotmatic speech recognition in the assessment of speech quality for imparied speech.
